## How to find out your keyboard device?

1. Input `hyprctl devices` in your terminal

2. There are a lot of different devices but you need to find the one where your `active keymap` changes. Just try to switching the layouts, eventually you'll find it (in my case it's `asus-keyboard`)

3. Then just insert it into script in variable `DEVICE` 

4. Profit!
